I changed server.js so now it should resolve the path for index.html no matter what folder you stored the project in.
So, my config.js is:

export default{
    db: {
        uri: 'mongodb+srv://heavenlywriting:<password>@cluster0-u13yq.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority', //place the URI of your mongo database here.
    },
    port: 5000
};

Replace <password> with the password to MongoDB admin account heavenlywriting.

To run and test server:
    npm run-script server
    use Postman to test different http requests/responses to/from server

To run and test client:
    npm run-script client
    can use React Dev Tools if you have the extension installed

To run and test client + server (frontend and backend connectivity):
    npm run-script build (this will take a while)
    npm run-script server
    Go to localhost:5000 (the server on port 5000 should serve frontend pages)
